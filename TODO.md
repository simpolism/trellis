- Update README datasets in particular + tab descriptions
- Model tab for loading + hyperparams / LoRA config
- Easy 1-click undo on steer tab
- Tree tab doesn't work at all -- not persisting more than 2 nodes, step vs hash is unclear... need to rethink that entirely.
- Maybe remove branching and just do linear for now?
- Save adapter every step too in case u get cut off?
- Refactor into files...
